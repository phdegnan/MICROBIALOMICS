# MICROBIALOMICS
The initial impetus for this series of program tools was to aggregate Human Gut Microbial Genomes sequenced by various groups and organize them in a MySQL database using a common set of functional annotations. This database could then be used as the backend of a graphical genome browser (e.g., LWGV, GMOD) or other tools to analyze and understand genomes. These scripts have been adapted and used successfully on multiple campus clusters and large multiprocessor servers. These scripts are provided as-is and will require familiarity with PERL coding to be run on new platforms. Further, given changes to GenBank default formats since the initial coding of these programs, the continued use of these programs is questionable. However, they are provided here for legacy purposes.
